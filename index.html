  <h1>Mik√§ GitHub on?</h1>
  <p>GitHub, Inc. is a subsidiary of Microsoft which provides hosting 
    for software development and version control using Git. It offers 
    the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) 
    functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access 
    control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, 
    feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis 
    for every project.[3] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary 
    of Microsoft since 2018.[4]

    GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional 
    and enterprise services are commercial.[5] Free GitHub accounts are commonly used 
    to host open-source projects.[6] As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private 
    repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators
     per repository for free.[7] Starting from April 15, 2020, the free plan allows unlimited collaborators, 
     but restricts private repositories to 2,000 minutes of GitHub Actions[8] per month.[9] As of January 2020,
      GitHub reports having over 40 million users[10] and more than 190 million repositories[11]
       (including at least 28 million public repositories),[12] making it the largest host of source 
       code in the world.[13] </p>
<h2> What is a pull request in GitHub?</h2>
<p>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. 
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.</p>
